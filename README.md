# 🗣️ DeepFake Detection using Python

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook titled `speech_final.ipynb` that demonstrates how to convert real-time spoken audio into text using Python's `speech_recognition` library.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project captures voice input via microphone and transcribes it into text using Python. It uses the `SpeechRecognition` module and a simple microphone interface for real-time interaction.

## 🚀 Features

- 🎙️ Captures speech through your system microphone
- 🧠 Uses built-in recognizers (Google Web Speech API by default)
- 📝 Outputs transcribed text directly in the notebook
- ⏱️ Real-time processing with minimal delay

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- [`speech_recognition`](https://pypi.org/project/SpeechRecognition/)
- [`pyaudio`](https://pypi.org/project/PyAudio/)
- Jupyter Notebook
